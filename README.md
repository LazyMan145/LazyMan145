## My Projects
### 📌 Sattelit Tracker (https://github.com/LazyMan145/SattelitTracker)
Satellite Tracker is a Python-based application that provides real-time tracking of satellites. The application fetches the latest Two-Line Element (TLE) data from the Space-Track API and uses the sgp4 library to calculate and display the current position of the satellite on a map.
